# Hello, I'm Matthew, also known as PublicKip

<p> I recently joined <a target="_blank" href="https://www.code-crew.org/">CodeCrew</a> via <a target="_blank" href="https://changeiscollective.org/">The Collective Blueprint</a> seeking to expand my promgramming toolset. </p>
<p> Aside being an avid fighting game fan, my primary interests are peer-to-peer networking (a pandemic + Delay-based Netcode has forever scarred me), and aiding development on open sources tools I currently find or may find myself using in the future </p>
