# Hello, I'm Matthew, also known as PublicKip

<p> World's most empty github page of all time </p>
<p> Recent Memphis <a target="_blank" href="https://www.code-crew.org/">Code School</a> graduate </p>
<p> Aside being an avid fighting game fan, my primary interests are peer-to-peer networking (a pandemic + Delay-based Netcode has forever scarred me), and aiding development on open sources tools I currently find or may find myself using in the future </p>
